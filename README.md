## NOTE
**I attempted to create this website as a part of my learning experience with React and Flask. Unfortunately, due to some recent changes in my circumstances, I haven't been able to fully complete the project. I am now seeking someone who would be interested in taking over this project, and I would be more than happy to offer my assistance and guidance to ensure its successful continuation.**
